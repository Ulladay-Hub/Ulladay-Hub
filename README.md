## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm bradinator, and I am a weird 14 year old. I identify as they/them, and I am a intresting high school student. I started coding when I was 9, and I started doing Scratch ([this is my account btw](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/UdayFromYouTube/))

I'm currently working on some projects like indigo and sponge. Indigo is a futuristic terminal program I am working on solo. Sponge is a rust module I started quite recently, and it's for converting Rust to Assembly. I am trying to learn C++, but I already know Rust, Python, and Scratch. If anyone wants to tutor me, I would be happy. I'm looking to collaborate on
