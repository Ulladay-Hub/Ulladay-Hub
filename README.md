## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm bradinator, and I'm a weird 14-year-old! I identify as they/them, and I'm an intresting high school student. I started coding when I was 9 with Scratch ([check out my account btw](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/UdayFromYouTube/)). Then, when I was 10, I started Python, which I did for 2 whole years! Now, I'm into Rust. ðŸ¦€

I'm currently working on some projects like Indigo and Sponge. Indigo is a futuristic terminal program I'm doing solo. Sponge is a Rust module I started recently, and it's for converting Rust to Assembly. I'm trying to learn C++, but I already know Rust, Python, and Scratch. If anyone wants to tutor me, I would be soooo happy! ðŸ˜Š

I'm looking to colaborate on Sponge if anyone wants to help. You can reach me at [imnotamilkglass@gmail.com](mailto:imnotamilkglass@gmail.com). My discord is: @sirbradinator
